# Welcome to the Stata Cookbook
## for Introduction to Data Science

During the course “Introduction to Data Science”, we will start building our very own Stata Cookbook. This repository will hold a collection of useful Stata commands with notes on when and how to use them. 

We encourage you to use the joint Stata Cookbook for this course to build your own personal cookbook. Our shared collection of commands will cover most of the commands you will be using throughout the course, but there are good reasons to build on that foundation: perhaps you want to augment our notes on how to use commands, so that they are more clear or fit your preferred use better. Perhaps you found a useful commands or tricks online and you want to include them in your personal cookbook. Most importantly, once “Introduction to Data Science” ends, you will continue to use Stata in other courses. Having your own personal cookbook allows you to keep adding new commands and notes.

Finally, our cookbook is meant to be a collaborative effort. If you found a useful command or trick elsewhere, or if you have useful additions to the notes, you can contribute them to the shared cookbook for the benefit of everyone — and earn a bonus for your grade while you are at it!
